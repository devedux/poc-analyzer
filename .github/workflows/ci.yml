  # ─── Job 2: Integration tests — Neo4j ephemeral sidecar ───────────────────
  #
  # Anthropic/Google CI pattern:
  #   - Neo4j container is created fresh per job run (ephemeral).
  #   - Destroyed automatically when the runner exits. Zero cleanup needed.
  #   - Each matrix runner gets its own isolated Neo4j instance.
  #
  # Stripe/Google tenant isolation pattern (defense-in-depth):
  #   - Each test run also uses a unique TEST_RUN_ID in the org name.
  #   - If two jobs ever share a DB (e.g. local dev), they still don't collide.
